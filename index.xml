Obsidian I strongly recommend using Obsidian as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of my local files.

Of course, all the files are in Markdown so you could just use your favourite text editor of choice.</description></item><item><title>Ignoring Notes</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/ignore-notes/</guid><description>Quartz Ignore Edit ignoreFiles in config.toml to include paths you&amp;rsquo;d like to exclude from being rendered.

You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup .
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description></item><item><title>Preview Changes</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/preview-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/preview-changes/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here&amp;rsquo;s exactly how to do that!

Why Quartz? Hosting a public digital garden isn&amp;rsquo;t easy.

Yes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on excluding pages from being published .
Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages? Yes! All built files can be found under /public in the master branch. More details under hosting .
Do I need a website already? No! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)</description></item></channel></rss>
