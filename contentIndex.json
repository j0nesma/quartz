We then leave the office a guard greets us:\n- There has been a fight in ward 9\n\t- Guards are going to fight to subdue the incident\nAs we are walking through the wings dont make sense as:\n- 4 wings but the prison should fit 3\n- Turns out all prison wings are in pocket dimensions. \n\n## Entering Porcus' Wing\n- We entered the cells and found all mind control creatures tortured and killed.\n\t- Some mind control shit is coming I can smell it.\n- Head up to solitary confinement.\n\t- Box, covered in chains, a very tempting box. God damn we should have opened that box but Daira tried and she was freaked, I havent seen her like that since returning home from her first evening with her Dragon counterpart.\n\n## Research and Development\nOh no it is a puzzle. A very painful puzzle. \n\n### Obtained loot:\n- Books on Squirells\n- Anklet with acorns on\n\n### Back story/ LORE DUMP (loved it):\n- [Qidan Backstory](People/Players/Qidan.md#Recent%20Developments) \n\t- Should try and find a Male Firbolg in Ophise and a Locodon Taxidermist in The Lepus(?)\n- Daria\n\t- Hungering Gloom - with the word (IRA) on it\n- Vampiric sea creatures (The seal from before)\n- A sect of werewolf hoar worshipers\n- [The Syndicate](Organisations/The%20Syndicate.md)sent the horrible creatures to [Elunore](Elunore.md) which the previous members of the party plus Daria killed.\n\n### Events\n- Archi has a Shakespeare moment with [Morie Destroyer of Worlds](People/NPC/Morie%20Destroyer%20of%20Worlds.md)\n\t-  Ask him about the wars\n\t\t- He lies, as he always does. You think for a guy who is just a head in a bag of holding he would like the company.\n\t\t- Note for Daria, Clean the bag of holding we haven't done that for a while.\n- \"Idea Dumpnut...\" - I dont know why I wrote this down but i liked it so it can stay\n- Coloured Dragon's are evil and Daria was cancelled \n\n### Quest Related Tasks\n\n - [Cathuwu](Organisations/Cathuwu.md) (interitus?)\n\t - Still cant find \"adflictium(?)\"\n - We need to talk to Naberus about working for [The Syndicate](Organisations/The%20Syndicate.md) in making Automatons for them.\n - Research Largos when we can, as one was spotted in [Shrash](Shrash)\n - Zero gravity anomaly in the plane of water causing a lot of deaths. \n\t - Has this already happened? Or should we check in with the old Pirate Captain woman?\n\n## Time to make some piggy squeal\nWe start a battle against [Madame Porkus](People/NPC/Madame%20Porkus.md).",

    "content": "# Session 13\nI was delierious from Covid so my notes may not be as complete. \n\n## Battle of Porkus and the Searching the Room\nSo we do the deed, notable point Daria is blinded during the battle but still cannot be hit and takes out two dogs in the process. She is really impressively scary sometime. It was funny watching her walk into walls really didnt help my intimidation for my interrogation. I have such a short attention span. \n\nPorkus was kept alive for questioning. \n\n### I ask her about me:\n\nThe other two test subjects who went under the same Mycellium testing failed they could not manifests on there own network. Which made me feel a bit special.\n\n### We then ask her about the box:\n\"do not go near the box\" \"where are the guards...\"\n\t\tThere is a thing, a thing is in the box the thing is bad. \n\n3 left who are from the before times, what ever remains is within this box. I think his name Adflictium.\n\n### Around the Room\n\nFind a map showing that she is tracking a Syndicate Army in the huelian empire. This has been marked on our map. If anyone else reads these notes should we think about sending the Warewolves/Vampires to head them off?\n\n\n## Leaving the Ward\nWhen we kill Porcus the dimension she was in charge of collapses, we were smart and did it in the door way so we werent affected. But the Black Dragon was and it tried to escape but i had to seal it in with magic. I took his blood in a vile.\n\nBut then a massive Supernova (basically) happened. The Thyme Wastes were destroyed and all was left was the Box, Adflictium. Conspiracy Theory Ping\n\nThough I write the next part in tears. In the explosion [Brior](People/NPC/Brior.md) died. I couldn't find the body but there is no way he survived without me seeing his body. I will do anything to bring him back. He was wonderful Minotaur and was a great friend. \n\nThe rest of the party managed to escape unscathed and noticed the [Zentarum](Organisations/Zentarum.md) group which had been searching for us had arrived. We needed to leave so we ran away from the Destruction.\n\n## The Last Pint\nI make Daria immediately call [Corellien](People/NPC/Corellien.md) on the Motorolla Sending Stone. He is going to get to the box as fast as possible. He told us though that [Geralt of Rivania](People/Players/Ex-Players/Geralt%20of%20Rivania.md) has skipped town \"Something about witches\". Hopefully he will know how to at least store it safely.\n\nWe then look for a place to lay low. We come up with the idea to go to the place marked on the map by [Cathuwu](Organisations/Cathuwu.md). So we get ourselves a guide. HILL BILLY PETE to guide us to the site.\n\n## Arriving at the Observatory\nMeet Lexor who is running the top level observatory which has Mytz building quality. He very friendly to Winter and gets the person who runs the Observatory, Vlacnir. His eyes have a flickering of fire I dont really like him. Meet Graf Kokag who was Winters Hander he is angry at seeing him. I dont really like anyone here. We kill some oozes and sneak around for a bit. Winter is lead away. Archi follows and FINDS FUCKING SACRAFICIAL RITUAL SHIT HAPPENING AND WINTER IS GOING TO BE KILLED.  I polymorph Daria and wild shape as a bat down to the site. I drop Polymorph so Daria can be ready for a attack and well the bitch anit steathy with her heavy armour.... and so how that is my fault.\n\nWE ARE IN A FIGHT AGAIN.\n\n\nPS Note to self find [Mardred Blutgard, God](People/Gods/Mardred%20Blutgard,%20God.md) get God Rot....",
