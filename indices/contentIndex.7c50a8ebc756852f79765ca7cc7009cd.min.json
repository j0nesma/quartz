I have such a short attention span. \n\nPorkus was kept alive for questioning. \n\n### I ask her about me:\n\nThe other two test subjects who went under the same Mycellium testing failed they could not manifests on there own network.

I think his name Adflictium.\n\n### Around the Room\n\nFind a map showing that she is tracking a Syndicate Army in the huelian empire. This has been marked on our map.

But the Black Dragon was and it tried to escape but i had to seal it in with magic. I took his blood in a vile.\n\nBut then a massive Supernova (basically) happened. The Thyme Wastes were destroyed and all was left was the Box, Adflictium. Conspiracy Theory Ping\n\nThough I write the next part in tears. In the explosion [Brior](Campaign%201/People/NPC/Brior.md) died. I couldn't find the body but there is no way he survived without me seeing his body. I will do anything to bring him back. He was wonderful Minotaur and was a great friend. \n\nThe rest of the party managed to escape unscathed and noticed the [Zentarum](Campaign%201/Organisations/Zentarum.md) group which had been searching for us had arrived. We needed to leave so we ran away from the Destruction.\n\n## The Last Pint\nI make Daria immediately call [Corellien](Campaign%201/People/NPC/Corellien.md) on the Motorolla Sending Stone. He is going to get to the box as fast as possible. He told us though that [Geralt of Rivania](Campaign%201/People/Players/Ex-Players/Geralt%20of%20Rivania.md) has skipped town \"Something about witches\". Hopefully he will know how to at least store it safely.\n\nWe then look for a place to lay low. We come up with the idea to go to the place marked on the map by [Cathuwu](Campaign%201/Organisations/Cathuwu.md). So we get ourselves a guide. HILL BILLY PETE to guide us to the site.\n\n## Arriving at the Observatory\nMeet Lexor who is running the top level observatory which has Mytz building quality. He very friendly to Winter and gets the person who runs the Observatory, Vlacnir. His eyes have a flickering of fire I dont really like him. Meet Graf Kokag who was Winters Hander he is angry at seeing him. I dont really like anyone here. We kill some oozes and sneak around for a bit. Winter is lead away.

Adamantium. We need a Adamantium weapon. This is located in a mountain in Srash (thanks [Corellien](Campaign%201/People/NPC/Corellien.md)).\n\n\n##  The Beached Lady\nWe head to the casino! Where Daria meets some old friends the foxes who stole from party many moons ago. They provide a proposition to Archi in the form of a note to visit their cabin in the Casino. Archi gives the note to the head of Security. After a bit of tension we attend and met [Wayne](Campaign%201/People/Players/Ex-Players/Wayne.md) the rouge who proposes a heist which we accept. Key lesson Wayne learned was don't kill my bat or you don't get any money. The party is now delightfully rich. I think I will buy a plant. \n\n## Zidjomozh\nWe head to do some sight seeing and caught up with Mozdot. Suddenly a fight broke out! The [Cathuwu](Campaign%201/Organisations/Cathuwu.md) cult had found us and more importantly winter. After a long fight where I turned Mozdot into the giant ape, Winter became a god of a ant hill and Archi failed to do a one liner after killing the last cultist. We discovered that they were using Winters fur and divination magic to track him.\n\n## First meeting of the Council of the Snatchers\nWe meet up with Fang (wolfhound) and Holstien (vampires) leaders of our Army and send them to Srash to investigate the Adamantium and parley with the dwarves. The party then planned the next attack as a group. Most members wished to kill the syndicate and for my own selfish reasons I wanted to find out more about myself. So I proposed two birds one hand of corn (I'm a druid I don't kill birds) we head to [Ofheise](Campaign%201/Ofheise.md).\n\n## Subject 161\nThe [Senishal Trigres](Senishal%20Trigres) who rules [Ofheise](Campaign%201/Ofheise.md) had fled to the [[Campaign 1/Grand Duchy of Neforia]] we plan to give chase. I investigated around town and found some spores hovering in the air which lead me to the sewers. We met Subject 161 who was a deformed monster who was feeding on the citizens. I attempted to cure him but it didn't work and enraged him so he had to die.\n\n## Panda Land\nWe are chaperoned a lot during our time (Seong-ja wisehills) in the [Grand Duchy of Neforia](Campaign%201/Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Neforia.md) we visited the city centre where we bought animals and met [Sooki](Campaign%201/People/NPC/Sooki.md). Our guide who looks the same seems to change attitude a lot like someone else is acting as her. We go to the sauna with Huw Manne and Archi taking the men's side and me and Daria taking the ladies to talk to Lady Xiao Ming who we destroy also destroying some poor panda's nuts. Our best cover up was a earthquake.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.
